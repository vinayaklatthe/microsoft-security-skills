# Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault centrally and securely stores **secrets, keys, and certificates**, providing
RBAC-based access control, network isolation, logging, and lifecycle automation - so
applications never embed credentials and crypto material has a managed lifecycle.

## When to use
Managing application secrets, encryption keys (including customer-managed keys / BYOK), and
TLS certificates. Use this skill to pick standard vs Managed HSM, design access, and plan
rotation.

**Do not use this skill** for CA design (`pki-design`), Entra app credentials only
(`entra-id`), or PaaS networking topology (`azure-network-security-design`).

## Pick the vault type and access model

| Requirement | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Application secrets, TLS certs, software-protected keys | **Standard Key Vault** | Default; FIPS 140-2 Level 2 |
| Single-tenant HSM with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 keys (CMK, root CA) | **Managed HSM** | Regulated workloads |
| Per-app, per-environment isolation | **One vault per app per environment** | Limits blast radius |
| App reading secrets at runtime | **Managed identity + RBAC** (Key Vault Secrets User) | No secrets in code |
| App Service / Functions secret in config | **Key Vault references** in app settings | No code change |
| Customer-managed key for Storage / SQL | Key in Key Vault (or HSM) + identity grant | Rotate independently |

> **Rule of thumb:** **one vault per app per environment** (dev / test / prod). Don't share a
> vault across apps - a compromise of one app's identity reads all the others' secrets. Use
> Managed HSM only when the regulator or CMK boundary requires FIPS 140-3 Level 3.

## Approach

1. **Use Azure RBAC for the data plane** — Switch the vault to **RBAC permission model** (not
   legacy access policies). Assign least-privilege roles (`Key Vault Secrets User`,
   `Key Vault Crypto User`) to **managed identities**, not user accounts.
   *Verify: vault `enableRbacAuthorization = true`; no users with `Key Vault Administrator`
   in prod.*

2. **App access via managed identity + Key Vault references** — App authenticates with a
   system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity, fetches secrets at runtime.
   For App Service / Functions, use **Key Vault references** in app settings -
   `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)` - no SDK code change.
   *Verify: source code contains no plaintext secrets; managed identity has only the
   secrets role on the target vault.*

3. **Enable soft delete + purge protection** — Soft delete is on by default; **turn on
   purge protection** to make accidental or malicious key deletion non-recoverable for
   90 days. Required for CMK and most compliance scenarios.
   *Verify: `softDeleteRetentionInDays >= 7`; `enablePurgeProtection = true`.*

4. **Restrict network access** — For sensitive vaults, **disable public network access** and
   use **private endpoint** in the workload VNet. Firewall the rest with service tags or
   selected networks.
   *Verify: `publicNetworkAccess = Disabled`; private endpoint resolves; public IP test
   from internet = blocked.*

5. **One vault per app per environment** — Per-app blast radius. Cross-app reads are then a
   role grant, audited. Don't lump secrets into a shared vault.

6. **Automate rotation + monitor expiry** — Set expiry on secrets / certs; use **rotation
   policies** for certificate auto-renewal from issuer; for secrets, use Event Grid → Logic
   App / Function to rotate at the source and update the secret.
   *Verify: no secret in production has a NULL expiry; alerts fire 60 days before any cert
   or secret expires.*

7. **Monitor + Defender** — Enable diagnostic logs to Log Analytics; turn on **Defender for
   Key Vault** for anomalous access detection.

## Guardrails
- **One vault per app per environment limits blast radius and simplifies access control.**
  Shared vaults are an over-permission anti-pattern.
- **Purge protection is irreversible once on - required for CMK and many compliance
  scenarios.** Turn it on knowingly.
- **Never store secrets in source / config; use managed identity + Key Vault references.**
  Code-stored secrets leak via repo, logs, env-var dumps.
- **Disable public network access for sensitive vaults.** Open-to-internet Key Vault is a
  brute-force / credential-spray target.
- **RBAC, not access policies.** RBAC is the modern model with proper inheritance and
  PIM-eligible roles.
- **Don't grant `Key Vault Administrator` to apps.** Apps need read on secrets / keys, not
  admin.

## Common anti-patterns
- **"Shared 'enterprise' Key Vault for all apps"** - Compromise of one app reads everyone's
  secrets. Per-app per-environment.
- **"Access policies because we've always used them"** - Legacy; harder to audit. Use RBAC.
- **"No purge protection - we might need to delete"** - First malicious / accidental purge
  = data loss. Turn it on; deal with the irrevocability.
- **"Public network access on for convenience"** - Internet exposure. Private endpoint
  + firewall.
- **"Secrets in App Service application settings as plaintext"** - Visible to anyone with
  config read. Use Key Vault references.
- **"No expiry / no rotation"** - Long-lived secrets are a perpetual liability. Expiry +
  rotation policy.
- **"Same vault for app + CA root key"** - Mix of blast radii. CA / HSM keys in **Managed
  HSM**, separate from app secret vault.

## Example prompts
- `Set up Azure Key Vault with RBAC, purge protection, and a private endpoint.`
- `Configure an App Service to read secrets via managed identity and Key Vault references.`
- `When should I use Managed HSM instead of standard Key Vault?`
- `Plan one-vault-per-app-per-environment for our microservices estate.`
- `Automate certificate rotation in Key Vault with a 60-day expiry alert.`
- `Review my Key Vault access model for least privilege.`
